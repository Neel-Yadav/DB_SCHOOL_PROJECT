          <h2>History and Significance of Holi</h2>
          <p>
            Holi has its roots in Hindu mythology, especially the story of
            Prince Prahlad and the demoness Holika. According to legend,
            Prahlad, a devotee of Lord Vishnu, was saved from the flames by
            divine intervention, while Holika, his evil aunt, was destroyed.
            This symbolizes the victory of good over evil. Additionally, Holi
            also celebrates the playful and romantic tales of Lord Krishna and
            Radha, symbolizing love and togetherness.
