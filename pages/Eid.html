          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Eid, celebrated by Muslims around the world, is a joyful and sacred
            festival that occurs twice a year: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.
            These two festivals mark significant events in the Islamic faith and
            serve as occasions for family gatherings, prayer, and acts of
            charity. Eid brings together people in the spirit of compassion,
            unity, and gratitude.

          <h2>Types of Eid</h2>
          <p>Muslims celebrate two major Eids each year:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Eid al-Fitr:</strong> Known as the "Festival of Breaking
              the Fast," Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, a
              month of fasting, prayer, and reflection. It is a time for Muslims
              to give thanks to Allah for the strength to complete the fast and
              to seek forgiveness for any shortcomings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Eid al-Adha:</strong> Also called the "Festival of
              Sacrifice," Eid al-Adha commemorates the willingness of Prophet
              Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son in obedience to Allahâ€™s
              command. It is observed during the Islamic month of Dhul-Hijjah,
              coinciding with the annual Hajj pilgrimage.

          <h2>Significance and Traditions of Eid</h2>
          <p>
            Eid is rich in traditions that emphasize faith, gratitude, and
            generosity:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Prayer (Salah):</strong> Eid begins with a special prayer
              offered at mosques or large gathering spaces, where Muslims come
              together to offer thanks and seek blessings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Charity (Zakat al-Fitr and Qurbani):</strong> On Eid
              al-Fitr, Muslims give Zakat al-Fitr, a form of charity to the
              needy, ensuring everyone can partake in the celebrations. During
              Eid al-Adha, Qurbani (sacrifice) is performed, where animals are
              sacrificed, and the meat is shared with family, friends, and those
              in need.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Feasting and Visiting:</strong> Families prepare and share
              special meals, visit loved ones, and exchange greetings of "Eid
              Mubarak" (Blessed Eid). Traditional foods, sweets, and treats are
              enjoyed by all.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>New Clothes:</strong> Wearing new or special clothes is a
              common tradition on Eid, symbolizing renewal and the festive
              spirit.
