          <p>
            Navratri, a nine-day Hindu festival, is dedicated to the worship of
            Goddess Durga in her various forms. Celebrated with great enthusiasm
            across India and among Hindu communities worldwide, Navratri
            signifies the triumph of good over evil and celebrates the divine
            feminine energy. This vibrant festival involves prayer, fasting,
            dance, music, and devotion, and is observed twice a year in the
            spring (Chaitra Navratri) and fall (Sharad Navratri).

          <h2>History and Significance of Navratri</h2>
          <p>
            The term "Navratri" means "nine nights" in Sanskrit, and the
            festival celebrates Goddess Durga's victory over the demon
            Mahishasura. According to legend, Mahishasura, a powerful demon,
            could only be defeated by a female warrior, leading to the creation
            of Goddess Durga. After a fierce battle lasting nine days, she
            triumphed over Mahishasura on the tenth day, known as Vijayadashami
            or Dussehra. Navratri symbolizes the victory of light over darkness
            and good over evil.
